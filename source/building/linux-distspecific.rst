Fedora Core 8, openSUSE 10.2, RHEL/Centos 5
-------------------------------------------

I (DavidCournapeau) have packaged the last released of numpy, scipy as
well as lapack and blas dependencies for Fedora Core 8, opensuse 10.2
and Centos/RHEL 5 and a few others thanks to the opensuse build
service. I strongly advise you to use those packages instead of the
"official" ones, which are often unusable. The repository is there:

http://software.opensuse.org/download/home:/ashigabou/

Basic install
#############

To use this repository with yum, simply pick up your
arch/distribution, and take the corresponding .repo file. Put this
.repo file into /etc/yum.repo.d/, and then install numpy/scipy with
yum::

  yum install python-numpy python-scipy

I also packaged timers and testers for blas and lapack, which can be
useful if you intend to compile special optimized versions of
BLAS/LAPACK (eg GOTO or ATLAS). You can also find the package
lapack3-pic, which can be used to build a complete LAPACK with ATLAS:
it is a static version, but as it is built with the -fPIC compiler
flag, it can be used to build python extensions; this is particularly
useful for x86_64 arch.

Building Atlas
##############

ATLAS is a BLAS/LAPACK implementation which tuned itself on the
machine to provide ideal performances, and often match vendor specific
implementations. Unfortunately, building ATLAS is not easy.  But, it
is getting easier all the time.

Building Atlas by Hand
######################

These instructions show how to build ATLAS (and LAPACK) from their
official distributions.

First, download and unpackage the LAPACK distribution from netlib (you
need these to build a complete version of LAPACK).

::

 wget http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-3.1.1.tgz
 tar zxvf lapack-3.1.1.tgz
 cd lapack-3.1.1

There are several make.inc files in the INSTALL directory of the
lapack distribution.  Copy one of those files to the main directory.
For example:

::

 cp INSTALL/make.inc.gfortran make.inc

Now, you must edit the make.inc file to ensure that the OPTS and NOOPT
lines both contain the flag for compiling position-independent code on
your platform (e.g. with gcc/gfortran it is -fPIC).  For example:

::

 OPTS = -O2 -fPIC
 NOOPT = -O0 -fPIC

(Note: Make sure that if you build with gfortran that g77 is not
installed on your system (or at least is not in your PATH when numpy
is being built) as you need to link with the same compiler that you
built lapack with when numpy builds. It will try and find g77 first
which will lead to linking errors if you have built lapack with
gfortran).  Then change to the SRC directory and run make

::

 cd SRC
 make


This will create an lapack_<XXXX>.a file in the head lapack directory.
You will need the location of this file to configure atlas.

Now, download the latest release of ATLAS (these instructions worked
on 3.7.37).  See, for example,
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23725.
Unpackage the result, change to the directory created, and create a
directory to contain the resulting build.  This directory should be
named appropriate for the platform (you can build for multiple
platforms from the same SOURCE tree --- perhaps the source is on a
network drive and builds are taking place for multiple platforms).

::

 tar jxvf atlas3.7.37.tar.bz2
 cd ATLAS
 mkdir ATLAS_<my_platform_type>


::

 cd ATLAS_<my_platform_type>
 ../configure -Fa alg -fPIC --with-netlib-lapack=/path/to/lapack/lapack_<XXXX>.a
 make

Your atlas libraries should now be in the lib subdirectory of the
current directory.  You should copy them to some-place that you can
tell site.cfg about so that numpy and scipy can pick them up.  If you
want to create shared libraries, then you can do that by

::

 cd lib
 make shared     # for sequential libraries
 make ptshared   # for threaded libraries


after changing to the lib directory where the .a files are already
located.

Building Atlas with atlas-XXX.src.rpm from Ashigabou Repository
###############################################################

ashigabou repository does not provide binary versions, but provides
all the tools to make the building process of ATLAS almost painless:
it will build a complete LAPACK, build it with the right fortran
compiler to avoid ABI issues (eg _gfortran_string_write, etc...), and
with the right compiler flags such as it is usable to build numpy and
scipy (with the -fPIC option).

First, download the source rpm included in the ashigabou repository
(the file atlas-version.src.rpm), and install from the ashigabou
repository the package lapack3-pic (the rpm will refuse to build
without it). Then, use the following:

::

 rpm -ivh atlas-version.src.rpm


This will NOT install atlas, just uncompress all the necessary files
for building the rpm in /usr/src/packages. Before building atlas, you
must disable dynamic change of CPU frequency (used to decrease battery
consumption):

::

 cpufreq-selector -g performance


If this fails telling you no cpufreq support, this is fine. Now, to
build the rpm, go into the directory /usr/src/packages/SPEC, and
execute

::

 rpmbuild -ba atlas.spec


This will build the rpm: this can take a long time, even on a powerful
machine. What matters is whether atlas has arch defaults for your
machine: if not, it can take several hours (it takes 2 hours and a
half on a P4 @3.2 Ghz, but takes ~10 minutes on my macbook under
linux). If successfull, you will get an installable rpm in
/usr/src/packages/RPMS/ARCH (where ARCH can be x86_64 or i586 or
something else depending on the distribution and your arch).

The rpm contains two (shared) libraries: libblas.so and liblapack.so,
installed in /usr/lib/atlas/sse2. They are meant to be drop-out for
the standard BLAS and LAPACK (the ones in refblas3 and lapack3). To
use the atlas libraries, once you installed numpy and scipy, you
should tell the OS to use atlas instead of default libraries by using
LD_LIBRARY_PATH. That is, normally, you can use numpy by :

::

 python -c "import numpy as N; a=N.random.randn(1000, 1000); N.dot(a, a)"


To use atlas, you do:

::

 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/atlas/sse2 python -c "import numpy as N; a=N.random.randn(1000, 1000); N.dot(a, a)"


If everything is working correctly, you will see that the above script
runs much faster with atlas than without (I see a ten fold speed
increase on my machine).

Debian / Ubuntu - Andrew Straw's unofficial repository
------------------------------------------------------

Andrew Straw has an unofficial repository for !NumPy .deb
packages. These were built with `stdeb <http://stdeb.python-hosting.com/>`__.
The binaries are for Ubuntu Dapper (6.06 LTS).

Binary packages Ubuntu Dapper (6.06), (i386 and amd64 architectures)
####################################################################

To use the binary package in Ubuntu Dapper, add the following line to
your /etc/apt/sources.list:

::

 deb http://debs.astraw.com/ dapper/


Then type

::

 sudo apt-get install python-numpy


You can verify ATLAS support by running the command ::ldd
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/numpy/linalg/lapack_lite.so}}}, which
should result in output like the following:

::

 liblapack.so.3 => /usr/lib/atlas/liblapack.so.3 (0x00002aaaaabcf000)
 libblas.so.3 => /usr/lib/atlas/libblas.so.3 (0x00002aaaab435000)

To download and build, type:

::

 sudo apt-get build-dep python-numpy
 sudo apt-get -b source python-numpy


GPG Verification using Andrew Straw's repository
################################################

When you start using this repository, you might get warning messages
like this:

::

 The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available.


Or you will be asked questions like this over and over:

::

 WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated!
 ...
 Install these packages without verification [y/N]?


Install the package {{{astraw-keyring}}} to eliminate these
messages. This installs Andrew's archive signing key to your apt
through the apt-key add command.

Debian sarge notes
##################

If you install !NumPy or !SciPy ontop of a debian sarge installation
for a CPU with SSE2, there is a bug in libc6 2.3.2 affecting floating
point operations (fixed in version 2.3.3). Due to this bug, the numpy
and scipy tests crach with a SIGFPE. Since there is now patch
available, in order to fix this the libc6 sources need to be
downloaded, fixed, and rebuilt. See
`Andrew Straw's instructions <http://www.its.caltech.edu/~astraw/coding.html#libc-patched-for-debian-sarge-to-fix-floating-point-exceptions-on-sse2>`__
for more information.

Ubuntu notes
############

If you choose *not* to use Andrew Straw's repository (which
includes numpy built with ATLAS support), here are some further notes
to build numpy and scipy from sources on your computer.

First, you need to install several libraries/tools (you need to enable
universe repository for some of those packages):

::

 sudo apt-get install gcc g77 python-dev atlas3-base-dev


To use optimized lapack and blas, you should also install the atlas
corresponding to your achitecture: atlas3-sse2-dev if you have a CPU
with SSE2 capabilities, atlas3-sse-dev if you have a CPU with SSE
capabilities only, etc... If you have a recent x86 (eg intel or AMD
cpu), it should support SSE2. To check whether your CPU supports sse,
sse2, etc.. you can check using the following command:

::

 cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags


and check whether sse, sse2, etc... appear on it.

Then, you can build numpy with the following, inside the numpy source
directory:

::

 python setup.py build


Then, to install it system-wide (requires root privileges):

::

 python setup.py install


To install it in another directory, you need to use the prefix
option. For example, I like to install local softwares in my
$HOME/local, so I do the following:

::

 python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/local


Note that if you do not install numpy system wide, you need to tell
python to look for the directory where you installed numpy. For
example, if you use $HOME/local as the former example, then you should
add $HOME/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages in your PYTHONPATH:

::

 PYTHONPATH=$HOME/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages python


(change python2.4 to python2.5 if you are using python2.5, obviously).

openSUSE
--------

(This section reflects the situation of July 2009. If you have newer
of more accurate information, feel free to modify this section.)

OpenSUSE does not contain *Numpy*, *Scipy* or *Matplotlib*
in the standard installation. Instead those packages are provided by
additional repositories, that seem to be run by volunteers. However
Novell provides webspace for some of those repositories. Packages
usually exist only for a few current SUSE versions.

The following repositories are currently the best to obtain
*Numpy*, *Scipy* and *Matplotlib*. They can be added to
the package manager (*YaST*) with the *Installation Source*
dialog. The packages will then appear in the *Software Management*
dialog.

Alternatively the ``*.rpm`` files can be downloaded and installed manually
(for example 'rpm -U <filename>' or with 'kpackage').


* Science: http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/science/

  * This repository contains: *Numpy*, *Scipy*,
    *Matplotlib*, and many more packages of interest for
    scientific users.

  * Installation was tested with openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1, both i586
    and x86-64.

    * For openSUSE 11.1-x586 additionally the
      `Packman repository <http://en.opensuse.org/Additional_YaST_Package_Repositories#Packman>`__
      was required as an 'Installation
      Source'. Select a suitable mirror from the
      `list <http://en.opensuse.org/Additional_YaST_Package_Repositories#Packman>`__.

* Education: http://www.opensuse-education.org/download/repo/1.0/

  This project seems to have some backing from Novell. It is
  primarily oriented towards schools. The repository was added
  despite of the broken packages, because it is big and still
  active. Also its relatively wide audience (schools) might lead to
  continuing development. (The author of this section has also filed
  bug reports in their Bugzilla.)

  * This repository contains: *Numpy*, *Scipy*,
    *Matplotlib*, and very many other packages.

  * Repository has own Bugzilla:
    http://devzilla.novell.com/education/enter_bug.cgi and Website:
    http://en.opensuse.org/Education

  * Tested with openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1, x86-64:

    * openSUSE 11.0: *broken* package *Scipy*
    * openSUSE 11.1: one error in scipy.test(), package seems
      (mostly) functional though.


Alternatively one can search for packages in repositories hosted by
Novell here: http://software.opensuse.org/search

One can also search for packages in the very big Packman repository:
http://packman.links2linux.org/

* Lists of Packman mirrors:
  `[1] <http://en.opensuse.org/Additional_YaST_Package_Repositories#Packman>`__,
  `[2] <http://packman.links2linux.de/MIRRORS.html>`__

* The packman repository should be given a low priority (high value,
  for example 200, in priority field). It contains very many
  packages, that are also present in SUSE's standard
  repositories. These packages might otherwise override original
  packages from SUSE.

Users of older versions of SUSE/openSuse can install *Sage*, a big
collection of Mathematics related software. It was recently
(Jul. 2009) reported that compiling and installing Sage from sources
worked flawlessly, on SUSE Linux 10.2:

* Sage http://www.sagemath.org/download-source.html

* A more detailed description
  `how to install Sage from sources <http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/Linux#head-f4511786c10fc5a608027f22e65df5e5078357b6>`__
  is on this page too.


ATLAS
#####

`ATLAS <http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/>`__ is a replacement for
`BLAS <http://www.netlib.org/blas/index.html>`__ and parts of
`LAPACK <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/index.html>`__, that is much faster.
It must be built from sources, because it optimizes itself for the
computer's processor.  The build process will run for ten minutes to
several hours.

*There is currently no comfortable way to use ATLAS on openSuse.*

The
`build instructions for ATLAS <http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/Linux#head-89e1f6afaa3314d98a22c79b063cceee2cc6313c>`__ on this page work, but unfortunately the
Numpy and Scipy packages don't work with ATLAS.  One could build Numpy
and Scipy from sources though, and a relatively painless way to do
this is the
`Sage <http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/Linux#head-f4511786c10fc5a608027f22e65df5e5078357b6>`__ package. (If you know a comfortable way to make ATLAS work on
openSuse, please put it here into the Wiki.)

David Cournapeau has a repository devoted to ATLAS, but he has not
added packages for recent SUSE versions.

* Ashigabou http://software.opensuse.org/download/home:/ashigabou/

  This repository contains: *ATLAS* and additionally other
  scientific software.


Broken BLAS
###########

SUSE (and Red Hat) regularly shipped versions of the BLAS library
where some functions were missing. This bug has finally been fixed in
March 2007. This means SUSE 10.2 and prior come with a broken BLAS, in
later versions SUSE's original BLAS should work. Unfortunately the
repositories mentioned here do no longer contain corrected/complete
packages of BLAS and LAPACK for the affected versions (SUSE 10.2 and
older).

The bug's cause was as follows: The BLAS rpm is created from
`Netlib's <http://www.netlib.org>`__
`LAPACK package <http://www.netlib.org/lapack/index.html>`__ and not from
the `BLAS package <http://www.netlib.org/blas/index.html>`__. Until March
2007 however the LAPACK library did only contain a subset of the
functions that were in BLAS.  Finally someone begged the LAPACK
developers to include the whole BLAS library in the LAPACK package,
and they did.

For details see: https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=228824
and http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack-3.1.1.changes


Building everything from source with gfortran on Ubuntu
-------------------------------------------------------

This is how I built everything from source on a 64 bit Ubuntu system
with latest versions as of February 2008. It took me some time to work
out the issues so I thought I'd put the details here. I believe it
should work the same on 32 bit systems (leaving out 64 bit related
options).

Install required packages
#########################

::

 sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev swig gfortran


Install nose (easy_install nose). Do not install python-nose, it is an
earlier version that doesn't work with scipy. Also make sure g77 is
not installed. Distutils will not use gfortran if g77 is installed.

::

 sudo apt-get remove python-nose
 sudo apt-get remove g77
 sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
 sudo easy_install nose



Build lapack (3.1.1)
####################

As described above, copy make.inc.gfortran, add -fPIC flags (and -m64
if building 64 bit) to OPTS and NOOPT. Run make in SRC directory.

Build ATLAS (3.8.0)
###################

As described above untar, create a directory for your build in ATLAS
and run configure (add option '-b 64' for 64 bit).

::

 sudo cpufreq-selector -g performance
 ../configure -b 64 -Fa alg -fPIC --with-netlib-lapack=/path/to/lapack/lapack_<XXXX>.a
 make


Copy the libraries to a lib directory (/usr/local/lib or
~/scipy_build/lib for example). I found it's easier to copy all needed
libraries and files to a common directory.

Build UMFPACK (5.2.0)
#####################

Get the latest versions of AMD, UFconfig and UMFPACK and untar them
into a directory.

UFconfig/UFconfig.mk should contain:

::

 CC = gcc
 CFLAGS = -O3 -fexceptions -m64 -fPIC
 F77 = gfortran
 F77FLAGS = -O -m64 -fPIC
 BLAS = -L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.2.1 -L/home/robince/scipy_build/lib -llapack -lf77blas -lcblas -latlas -lgfortran
 LAPACK = -L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.2.1 -L/home/robince/scipy_build/lib -llapack -lf77blas -lcblas -latlas -lgfortran


On a 32 bit system, remove the -m64 flags and change the first -L
option to -L/usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/4.2.1.

Run 'make' in UMFPACK directory. Copy resulting libraries and include
files.

::

 cp AMD/Lib/libamd.a ~/scipy_build/lib
 cp UMFPACK/Lib/libumfpack.a ~/scipy_build/lib
 cp AMD/Include/amd.h ~/scipy_build/lib/include
 cp UFconfig/UFconfig.h ~/scipy_build/lib/include
 cp UMFPACK/Include/*.h ~/scipy_build/lib/include


Copy libgfortran into scipy library directory (doesn't seem to work if
it doesn't find the umfpack_libs together).

::

 cp /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.2/libgfortran.* ~/scipy_build/lib/



Build FFTW (3.1.2)
##################

After untarring, run configure. I ran configure first and extracted
the suggested FLAGS from the Makefile, then added -fPIC and -m64. (Not
sure if this is necessary)

::

 ./configure --enable-sse2 --enable-threads --with-combined-threads CFLAGS="-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -fstrict-aliasing -ffast-math -pthread -fPIC -m64" FFLAGS="-g -O2 -fPIC -m64" CXXFLAGS="-g -O2 -fPIC -m64"
 make
 sudo make install


Build Numpy and Scipy
#####################

Set the following entries in site.cfg (this will also work with fftw
if it has been compiled and installed in the default location
(/usr/local):

::

 [DEFAULT]
 library_dirs = /usr/local/lib:/home/robince/scipy_build/lib
 include_dirs = /usr/local/include:/home/robince/scipy_build/lib/include

 [atlas]
 atlas_libs = lapack, f77blas, cblas, atlas

 [amd]
 amd_libs = amd

 [umfpack]
 umfpack_libs = umfpack, gfortran

 [fftw]
 libraries = fftw3


Build Numpy and Scipy.

::

 python setup.py build
 sudo python setup.py install



Any distribution with Intel C compiler and MKL
----------------------------------------------

The
`C compiler <http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/compilers/clin/219856.htm
Intel>`__ and
`MKL <http://www3.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/perflib/mkl/219859.htm
Intel>`__ are free for personal non-commercial use.

Add some variation of the following lines to site.cfg in your top
level numpy directory to use MKL:

::

 [mkl]
 library_dirs = /home/youruser/intel/mkl/8.1/lib/32
 mkl_libs = mkl, vml
 include_dirs = /home/youruser/intel/mkl/8.1/include


There are also libraries for the IA-64 and EM64T processors.

Modify cc_exe in numpy/numpy/distutils/intelccompiler.py to be
something like:

::

 cc_exe = 'icc -O2 -g -fomit-frame-pointer -mcpu=pentium4 -mtune=pentium4 -march=pentium4 -msse2 -axWN -Wall'


Run icc --help for more information on processor-specific options.

Compile and install !NumPy with the Intel compiler:

::

 python setup.py config --compiler=intel build_clib --compiler=intel build_ext --compiler=intel install


Compile and install !SciPy with the Intel compilers:

::

 python setup.py config --compiler=intel --fcompiler=intel build_clib --compiler=intel --fcompiler=intel build_ext --compiler=intel --fcompiler=intel install


You'll have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to

::

 ~/intel/mkl/8.1/lib/32/:~/intel/cc/9.1.044/lib

(exact values will depend on your architecture, compiler and library
versions) for !NumPy to work. This can still cause problems. The only
solution I've found that always works is to build Python, !NumPy and
!SciPy inside an environment where you've set the LD_RUN_PATH
variable, e.g:

::

 export LD_RUN_PATH=~/opt/lib:~/intel/cc/9.1.044/lib:~/intel/fc/9.1.039/lib:~/intel/mkl/8.1/lib/32

Configure Python with {{{--prefix=$HOME/opt}}}, make, make install,
add {{{$HOME/opt/bin}}} to the front of your PATH and then build
!NumPy and !SciPy with the {{{site.cfg}}} as above in their top level
directories (check the config step's output carefully to make sure it
selects MKL). Built like this, you shouldn't have to set any
LD_LIBRARY_PATH for !NumPy and !SciPy to work. Run the test suites to
verify this.

Other distributions
###################

For other distributions, see
`the unofficial instructions by written by Steve Baum <http://pong.tamu.edu/tiki/tiki-view_blog_post.php?blogId=6&postId=97>`__.

Any Linux distro: self-contained local installation with Sage
-------------------------------------------------------------

All you need is some basic tools like gcc (no fortran).

Follow the instructions here to build sage from source:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/source.html

All you have to do is unpack the tar and type *make*. This takes
about 3 hours.

This will install sage in its own directory. python (and ipython) can
be found in SAGEROOT/local/bin

If you don't want to have to type in absolute paths, you can set the
environment variables to point to your sage executables. To do this,
run sage with the -sh option. My .profile contains the line

::

 ~/Sage/sage -sh
